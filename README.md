# SE-Assignment-2
Assignment: Introduction to Software Engineering
Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of software engineering concepts. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

Questions:
Define Software Engineering:
software engineering is the study of designing, developing and maintaining a software.

What is software engineering, and how does it differ from traditional programming?
Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC):
Software engineering is the designing, development and maintenance of a software while SDLC is an approach for organizing the development of a project into phases and tasks from planning to implementation and support.

Explain the various phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. Provide a brief description of each phase.
Agile vs. Waterfall Models:
SDLC phases:
Planning - creation of a project plan
Analysis - identification of potential challenges and risks
Design - creation of detailed design of a software
Implementation - writing of the code and building the software
Testing - identifying and fixing any software defects
Deployment - release of the software to users
Maintenance - providing continued support
Agile concentrates on gathering user requirements first and creating large documentation, than delivering the project early and gathering feedback from users.
Waterfall consists of finishing each step before moving to the next step.

Compare and contrast the Agile and Waterfall models of software development. What are the key differences, and in what scenarios might each be preferred?
The key difference between Agile and Waterfall ia that Agile is good for long tern projects while Waterfall is best for short term projects.
Requirements Engineering:

What is requirements engineering? Describe the process and its importance in the software development lifecycle.
Engineering requirements is the process of gathering , analyzing and maintaining the requirements for a system.
The importance of requirements engineering is ensuring that the final product meeets the needs of the stakeholders and the users; that the development goals are successfully met.

Software Design Principles:

Explain the concept of modularity in software design. How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems?
Testing in Software Engineering:
It is a design principle that breaks big problems into smaller manageable pieces.
It improves maintability and scalability of the systems by adapting to changes required by replacing,adding or removing modules withiut affecting the system.

Describe the different levels of software testing (unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing). Why is testing crucial in software development?
Version Control Systems:
Unit testsing - the developer tests the code
Intergration testing - all the modules are intergrated
System testing - testing of the entire system
Acceptance testing - stakeholders and the users validates the software

Software testing is crucial because it identifies issues and defects with a written code so it can be fixed before the software product is delivered
It improves the quality of a sotware product

What are version control systems, and why are they important in software development? Give examples of popular version control systems and their features.
Software Project Management:
Version constrol systems are the software tools that help a software team manage changes to source a code. It is the practice of tracking and managing changes to source a code.
Version control systems helps developers move faster to presesrve efficency and agility as the team scales to include more developers. Examples of a version control system are GIT, BAZAAR, SVN.

Discuss the role of a software project manager. What are some key responsibilities and challenges faced in managing software projects?
Software Maintenance:
A software project manager plays the role of planning, scheduling, budgeting, monitoring and controlling software projects.
Some of the challenges faced by a software project manager are:
-lack of propers skills of a project team.
-budgeting issues.
-limited engagement of the stakeholders.
-lack of clear goals on the projects.

Define software maintenance and explain the different types of maintenance activities. Why is maintenance an essential part of the software lifecycle?
Software maintenance is the process of changing, modifying and updating of softwares to keeep up wih the customer needs.
The different types of software maintenance are;
Corrective maintenance - It is the repair of defects found in the daily functions of the systems.
Adaptive maintenance - It is the implemntation of changes in one part of the affected system.
Perfect maintenance - It is the implementation of a new or changed needs of users.
Preventive maintenance - It involves performing activities to prevent errors of a system.
Software manitenance is essenstial  because it enhances increased user satisfaction.

Ethical Considerations in Software Engineering:

What are some ethical issues that software engineers might face? How can software engineers ensure they adhere to ethical standards in their work?
-Data collection challenges
-Algaorithim difficulties
-Privacy and information concerns
-Design challenges
-Gender and racial discrimination

Software engineers can ensure they adhere to ethical standards at work by engaging and advocating in ethical considerations and prioritizing accountability.
